# About me

Name's Fluffy. I've been using a computer since I was 5 years old. Made my first computer malware at the age of 8 and since then I've been programming, hacking and more. Feel free to contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/FluffySnowmanYT) or [email](mailto:thefluffysnowmanyt@gmail.com) or Discord: `FluffySnowman#1337` or Telegram: `@FluffySnowman` if you just want to chat about technology or anything really.
I am experienced in Cyber Security, Linux, Network Administration, random programming, and much more!
